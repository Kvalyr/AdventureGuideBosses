Players who are running LFR and wish to quickly look up the next boss fight mechanics may find themselves without an idea of which boss is next.

This add-on solves this by organizing raid bosses in the Adventure Guide by the order in which they are encountered in LFR.

Additionally the bosses are grouped and labeled by the raid wing they are encountered in.
